# kevinddchen.github.io

Here I am using SDK Bundle, but it is very similar to the SDK for Embeds.

<a href="index.html">index.html</a> contains the basic webpage.
<a href="index.js">index.js</a> contains the Javascript.

I think Github hosts the `main` branch to the domain name <a href="https://kevinddchen.github.io/">kevinddchen.github.io</a>. 
I don't mind if you commit directly to the main branch.
If you want to host your own site, you can fork this repo or copy the code over.
